# Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year.
# A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February.
# The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating,
# this video does it more justice:

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
# if (year % 4) == 0:
#     if (year % 100) == 0:
#         if (year % 400) == 0:
#             print("{0} is a leap year".format(year))
#         else:
#             print("{0} is not a leap year".format(year))
#     else:
#         print("{0} is a leap year".format(year))
# else:
#     print("{0} is not a leap year".format(year))

if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 100 == 0:
        if year % 400 == 0:
            print("leap year")
        else:
            print("not leap year")
        else:
            print("leap year")
    else:
