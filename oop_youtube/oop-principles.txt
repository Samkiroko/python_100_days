Inheritance
____________


Inheritance is the process by which one class takes on the attributes and methods 
of another. Newly formed classes are called child classes, and the classes that
child classes are derived from are called parent classes.

Child classes inherits all of the parent's attribute and methods but can also 
extend and override attribute and methods that are unique to themselves.


polymorphism
____________

"Many Shapes"

We can write a code that works on the superclass, and it will work with  any 
subclass type as well.

Gives a way to use a class exactly like its parants, but each child class keep 
its own methods as they are.

Encapsulation 
_____________

Encapsulation is the mechanism of hidding of data implementation.

Instance variable are kept private and accessor methods are made public to 
achieve this. With this, we restrict access to public methods (getter/setter).

Abstraction
___________

Abstraction can be thought of as a natural extension of encapsulation.
Applying Abstraction means that each object should only expose a high-level 
mechanism for using it.

This mechanism should hide internal implementation details. 
It should only reveal operation relavant for the other objects
